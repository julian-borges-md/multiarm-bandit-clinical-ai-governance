## Overview

This repository provides a fully reproducible software framework for simulation based evaluation of deployment governance strategies in clinical artificial intelligence systems.

The framework implements contextual, cost aware multi arm bandit policies to support adaptive model selection among multiple pre trained and independently validated predictive models. The contribution of this project is deployment governance, not predictive model development.

The repository enables systematic study of how deployment policies behave under patient and operational heterogeneity, delayed outcome feedback, explicit safety and cost constraints, and fixed confidence decision rules.

This resource is intended for methodological research, audit informed governance studies, and reproducible evaluation of adaptive deployment strategies in clinical informatics and other safety critical domains.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Clinical AI systems are commonly deployed using static model selection, where a single model is chosen based on retrospective validation metrics and applied uniformly across patients, settings, and time.

Audit based research has demonstrated that such deployment strategies can obscure context specific misclassification patterns, shortcut learning and proxy signal reliance, subgroup specific safety risks, and operational inefficiencies.

Audits diagnose risk, but they do not provide a mechanism for controlling model exposure during deployment. This repository exists to evaluate adaptive governance mechanisms that translate audit insights into operational control.

Core premise: Model selection is a governance problem, distinct from model training and distinct from clinical intervention.

---

## What the Software Provides

The framework treats model selection as a sequential decision problem in which multiple validated predictive models coexist, patient context varies across decisions, outcome feedback is delayed, safety and operational cost priorities are explicit, and model exposure is governed by confidence based elimination.

At each simulated decision point, the governance layer selects which model to deploy according to a fixed confidence, audit informed policy. No predictive model parameters are updated during simulation.

This software does not provide clinical decision support and is not intended for real time patient care.

## Governance Design Principles

Governance oriented  
Focuses on deployment control rather than predictive accuracy optimization.

Audit informed  
Encodes known failure patterns, safety priorities, and cost constraints into governance logic.

Fixed confidence control  
Uses conservative action elimination to limit unsafe exposure rather than aggressive exploration.

Decision level evaluation  
Evaluates regret, safety outcomes, operational cost, exposure, and subgroup consistency.

Simulation first  
Uses retrospective simulation as an ethical prerequisite prior to any live deployment.

Reproducible by design  
Implements deterministic cohort selection, fixed random seeds, and version locked environments.

A detailed rationale for these design choices is provided in docs/governance-design-rationale.md.

## Health Impact and Care Process Relevance

Although this framework evaluates deployment governance rather than clinical intervention, the simulated outcomes correspond directly to care process impacts. These include reduced clinically harmful false negative predictions, improved reliability of AI assisted decisions over time, lower operational cost per prediction, and reduced inequitable exposure to unsafe model behavior.

These represent measurable improvements in decision safety, efficiency, and equity at the population level within a United States based critical care cohort.

## Pipeline Outputs and Generated Artifacts

All results reported in the associated manuscript are generated programmatically by the R scripts located in analysis/R. No manual data manipulation, interactive steps, or post hoc editing are required.

Key outputs generated by the pipeline include cohort flow and summary tables, feature completeness diagnostics, baseline model performance metrics, governance simulation traces, regret safety cost and equity outcomes, manuscript ready tables and figures, run manifests capturing execution metadata, output inventories enumerating all generated files, and execution logs for reproducibility and debugging.

All artifacts are saved under the outputs directory in both machine readable and publication ready formats.

## Analysis Pipeline Structure

The analysis pipeline is modular and executed sequentially via a single entry point.

analysis/R  
00_setup.R central configuration paths seeds logging  
00_run_all.R orchestrates full end to end pipeline  
01_build_cohort.R cohort construction and eligibility filters  
02_extract_features.R feature extraction and missingness diagnostics  
03_train_models.R baseline model training and prediction  
04_run_bandit_simulation.R governance simulation with delayed feedback  
05_make_tables_figures.R aggregation of manuscript ready outputs  

Running source("analysis/R/00_run_all.R") executes the full pipeline end to end and regenerates all tables figures and logs.

## Data Access and Requirements

This repository does not contain clinical data.

To reproduce the analyses users must obtain independent approved access to PhysioNet datasets such as MIMIC IV and comply with all applicable data use agreement requirements. Cohort construction feature extraction and governance simulation are performed locally after access approval and completion of required training.

---

## Reproducibility

Reproducibility is implemented through version locked R environments using renv, project relative file paths for portability across systems, fully scripted cohort construction governance simulation and evaluation, fixed random seeds for sampling delayed feedback and stochastic components, and persisted cohort identifiers enabling exact reruns.

Together these measures support transparent and auditable reproduction by qualified users with approved data access.

---

## Intended Use and Limitations

This software is intended for simulation based evaluation of deployment governance strategies, methodological research in adaptive and sequential decision systems, and audit and safety oriented clinical informatics research.

This software is not intended for clinical deployment real time decision support or patient care. Any extension beyond retrospective simulation requires independent validation formal governance review and appropriate institutional oversight.

---

## Ethics and Compliance

This project involves secondary analysis of fully deidentified electronic health record data accessed under approved PhysioNet credentialing. No new data collection was performed. The work is limited to retrospective simulation and does not involve patient intervention or prospective deployment.

Users are responsible for complying with all dataset credentialing training and data use agreement requirements.
