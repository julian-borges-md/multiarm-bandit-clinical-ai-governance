# Outputs

This directory is generated by the analysis pipeline and contains derived artifacts only.

No clinical data are included in the repository. By default, the following subdirectories are
excluded from version control to prevent accidental disclosure of derived datasets and model objects:

- outputs/data
- outputs/models
- outputs/cache_raw

Manuscript ready tables and figures may be selectively committed depending on journal policy.
Execution logs are retained locally to support debugging and reproducibility audits.
